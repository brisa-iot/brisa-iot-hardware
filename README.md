# BRISA Hardware Files

Welcome to the **BRISA** (Boya inteRconectada e Inteligente de bajo coSto para Aplicaciones de Monitoreo Costero) hardware repository.

This repository contains the **schematics**, **PCB layout**, and **Gerber files** necessary for fabricating and assembling the electronic components of the BRISA buoy.

## Project Overview

**BRISA** is a smart, low-cost buoy designed for real-time coastal monitoring. It integrates environmental sensors, GPS, wireless communication (LoRa), and solar power management in a compact, marine-resistant form factor.

This repository includes all the hardware design files necessary to reproduce the electronics of the BRISA buoy.
